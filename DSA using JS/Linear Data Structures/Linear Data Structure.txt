* Linear Data Structures => store elements in a sequential order, where each element has a unique predecessor and successor

it's generally simpler and allows easier access to elements.

1. Arrays =>
    * Fixed-size, contiguous block of memory.
    * Accessed by inices.

2. Strings =>
    * Sequential Access, contiguous memory location.
    * Index based access.
    * Fixed order.

3. Linked Lists =>
    * Sequence of nodes, where each nodes points to next node.
    * Variants inlcudes Singly, Doubly and Circular linked lists.

4. Stacks =>
    * Follows Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
    * Allows operations at one end only, typically the top.
    * eg: CallStack in JS along with the execution context.

5. Queues =>
    * Follows First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
    * operations allowed at both ends (insertion at rear, deletion at front).   

6. Hash Tables(with linear probing) =>
    * stores datas in key-value pairs.
    * uses linear probing as a collision resolution technique, making the structure follow linear-like access patterns in specific scenarios.
