//Graphs =>  A nonlinear datastructure in which elements are called nodes or vertices and are connected by edges. Its used to create connections, paths etc

//Types of Graphs =>
//1. Undirected Graphs => edges have no direction from one vertex to another
//2. Directed Graphs => edges have a direction from one vertex to another
//3. Weighted Graphs => edges carry weights indicating the cost or distance between vertices
//4. Unweighted Graphs => all edges are treated equally without any weights
//5. Sparse Graphs => a graph with a small number of edges
//6. Dense Graphs => a graph with a large number of edges
//7. Tree Graphs => a graph that is connected and acyclic 
//8. Cycle Graphs => a graph that has at least one cycle
//9. Acyclic Graphs => a graph that has no cycles


// Adjacency matrix => a 2d array where matrix[i][j] = 1 indicates an edge between vertex i and vertex j.
// Adjaceney list => an array of lists where each list contains neighbours of a vertex.
